Thing 1 (Transformation – Literature Review Start)

Plan:
Read the 2021 review paper:
Frontiers in Neurorobotics – “Review of Brain-to-Brain Communication”
https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurorobotics/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2021.656943/full

Take notes on:

Methods used for B2B communication (non-invasive vs invasive).

Main challenges (signal quality, ethics, latency).

Open research questions.

Results – Notes from Nam et al. (2021) Systematic Review of Brain-to-Brain Interfaces

Methods (B2B communication approaches)

BCI (reading brain signals):

Non-invasive: EEG (80% of studies, all human experiments). Motor imagery (MI) and SSVEP used to generate binary signals.

Invasive: Intracortical microelectrodes (ICM) and optogenetics (rodents). Higher accuracy, but limited to animal models.

CBI (writing to brain):

Non-invasive: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (tMS, 40%), Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS, 13%).

Invasive: ICM (40%), optogenetics (rare, rodent-only).

Common targets: Somatosensory cortex (33%), motor cortex (27%), visual cortex (20%).

tMS often produced phosphenes as binary indicators in human studies.

Collaboration models:

Mostly 1:1 direct unidirectional (73%).

Rare cases of N:N (rodent networks) or N:1 (humans coordinating via one receiver).

Cross-species experiments (human → rodent, human → cockroach) demonstrate flexibility.

Main Challenges:

Signal quality & accuracy: EEG lacks spatial resolution → limited to binary communication; invasive methods more accurate but impractical for humans.

Stimulation limitations: No consensus on best CBI method. tFUS promising but mechanisms unclear.

Latency & throughput: Current systems transmit only low-bandwidth, binary data.

Standardization: No agreed definition of “true” B2BI; collaboration models remain simplistic.

Ethical concerns: Invasiveness, consent, thought privacy, potential military use.

Open Research Questions:

Can non-invasive BCIs achieve higher resolution beyond EEG (e.g., fNIRS, fMRI)?

What is the best safe and precise neuromodulation method in humans (tMS vs tDCS vs tFUS)?

How to scale from binary to richer symbolic or emotional communication?

How to create true bidirectional systems with feedback loops?

What ethical frameworks are needed before deployment?

Overall Results & Insights:

B2BI is young but promising: only 15 experimental studies (2013–2020) met strict criteria.

Proof-of-concept studies demonstrate binary communication and cross-species links.

Applications: rehab (stroke recovery), locked-in patient communication, collaborative problem-solving, animal brain networks.

More complex models, non-invasive tools, and standardization are needed before practical human communication becomes realistic.

Thing 2 (Transformation – Compare Perspectives)

Plan:
Explore the 2022 overview paper:
“Direct Brain-to-Brain (B2B) Communication Without Interface – Applications: Fact or Fiction”
https://www.scivisionpub.com/pdfs/direct-brain-to-brain-b2b-communication-without-interface-applicationsfact-or-fiction-2333.pdf

Compare with 2021 review:

Optimistic vs skeptical tone.

Applications mentioned.

Risks or limitations discussed.

Results:

The planned 2022 paper link did not load, so I was unable to access that source directly.

Instead, I searched broadly online and reviewed other articles about brain-to-brain communication.

Key insight:

Most experimental BTBI relies on BCI + CBI (recording brain signals, then stimulating another brain).

“True” BTBI without interface (direct thought-to-thought verbal or emotional communication) remains speculative and not experimentally demonstrated.

This revealed a conceptual split in the literature:

Engineering perspective → BCI/CBI pipelines, measurable and testable.

Speculative perspective → human telepathy-like ideas, still science fiction.

Even though the original comparison plan didn’t work, adapting led to a clearer boundary between realistic and speculative BTBI.

Thing 3 (Maintenance – Keep Up With News & Grants)

Plan:
Review the 2025 NSF grant article:
https://newsroom.niu.edu/600000-nsf-grant-to-explore-brain-to-brain-communication-potential/

Summarize:

What the grant is funding.

NIU researchers’ goals.

How it connects to Thing 1 & Thing 2.

Bookmark in GitHub “Resources.”

Results:

What the grant is funding:
$600,000 NSF grant (PI: Chang Soo “CS” Nam, Co-PI: Xiaoning Jiang) to develop two-way brain-to-brain communication systems, extending beyond prior one-way approaches.

How the research will work:

Record brain signals with EEG, MEG, fNIRS.

Transmit via stimulation (e.g., tFUS) to another person’s brain.

Goal: first bidirectional B2BI system.

NIU researchers’ broader goals:

Enable non-verbal, gesture-free communication.

Applications in medicine (locked-in patients, stroke recovery) and rapid idea-sharing among healthy individuals.

Provide hands-on research opportunities for students in multiple disciplines.

Connection to Thing 1 & Thing 2:

Confirms the BCI + CBI model as the dominant approach (Thing 2).

Embodies the optimism of the 2021 review (Thing 1) by actively pursuing bidirectional models.

Still acknowledges limitations: communication is mediated by technology, not “pure” telepathy.

Final Reflection (Daily Insights – 2025-09-25)

Today’s work clarified three essential layers of the BTBI field:

Scientific foundations (Thing 1): Proof-of-concept studies show that BCI + CBI pipelines can enable simple information transfer, though current systems remain limited to binary or very low-bandwidth communication.

Conceptual boundaries (Thing 2): By adapting when a source was unavailable, I identified a key distinction between experimental BTBI (interface-mediated) and speculative BTBI (direct thought-to-thought).

Future direction (Thing 3): The NSF-funded NIU project embodies the optimism of pushing toward bidirectional systems, but also grounds the work in technological mediation, confirming the field’s balance between ambition and realism.

Overall Insight: BTBI research is advancing as a hybrid of engineering and imagination — real progress is happening in interface-mediated pipelines, while the dream of “true” telepathy remains speculative.
