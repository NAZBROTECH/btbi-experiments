### Topic 1 – Production-Scale Inference & Model Serving: Lessons from Triton
Reference:
- https://medium.com/neuralbits/deploying-deep-learning-models-at-scale-triton-inference-server-0-to-100-ae0f5e7d88b5

Summary:
- Triton is an open-source inference serving platform supporting TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT and more.
- It handles model execution through HTTP/REST, gRPC, and C-API with dynamic batching and concurrency scheduling.
- Useful for scaling real-time, multi-model AI deployments on CPU, GPU, cloud or edge devices.

Insight for Synapse:
A system like Triton could support large-scale neural-signal encoding/decoding models if Synapse grows toward real-time communication pipelines.

### Topic 2 – Synapse Strategy: Considering Backend Infrastructure for Scalable Neural-Signal Processing
Plan:
1. Draft an initial backend architecture outline showing how Synapse could use Triton to run decoding/encoding models.
2. Expand documentation on how a production-grade inference server requires strict privacy, consent, and ethical guardrails.

Insight:
Even if Synapse grows into a scalable real-time communication backend, ethics must scale equally with technology.
