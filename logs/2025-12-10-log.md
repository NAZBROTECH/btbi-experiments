Summary:
Neurons communicate through rapid electrical impulses called action potentials, the "spark of life" that enables everything from reflexes to complex thought. These all-or-nothing signals travel along axons at speeds up to 120 m/s, converting chemical gradients into electrical bursts.
Key phases: Resting potential (-70mV, maintained by Na+/K+ pumps); depolarization (stimulus opens Na+ channels, influx raises voltage to +30mV); repolarization (K+ efflux restores negativity); hyperpolarization (brief undershoot); refractory period prevents backward firing.
Role in synaptic transmission: Action potentials trigger neurotransmitter release at axon terminals, bridging to postsynaptic neurons. Types include sensory (input from environment) and motor (output to muscles), with interneurons handling integration. Historical nod to Galvani's frog experiments sparking bioelectricity studies.
Health implications: Disruptions cause epilepsy (hyperexcitability) or multiple sclerosis (demyelination slowing signals); therapies like anticonvulsants stabilize potentials.

Insight:
Action potentials are the fundamental "pulses" in neural communication—mirroring how Synapse must encode thoughts as discrete, all-or-nothing packets for reliable BTBI transmission. The refractory period inspires our Filter Core's cooldown mechanisms to prevent signal overload, while demyelination risks highlight the need for robust error-correction in noisy brain environments, tying directly to Hodgkin-Huxley simulations from yesterday's log.

### Topic 2 – Synapse Strategy: Integrating Action Potential Dynamics into BTBI Signal Encoding
Plan:
1. Enhance the neural signal generator with full action potential simulation: Add Na+/K+ channel models using simplified Hodgkin-Huxley equations, generating variable-speed spike trains based on "thought intensity."
2. Create Pydantic schema for ActionPotentialPacket: Fields like voltage_threshold (float), spike_amplitude (int), refractory_duration (ms), and propagation_speed (m/s) for structured encoding.
3. Prototype multi-neuron chain: Simulate action potential propagation across 3-5 virtual neurons, measuring fidelity loss and adding noise to test real-time communication resilience.
4. Link to historical blueprint: Update the docs/Historical_Blueprint.md with Galvani's bioelectricity milestone, mapping it to our spike train visuals.

Insight:
By modeling action potentials explicitly, Synapse gains hyper-realistic synthetic data for decoder training—turning abstract thoughts into quantifiable "sparks" that propagate across users without degradation. This elevates our simulations from basic EEG mimics to true BTBI prototypes, emphasizing speed and reliability as core to bypassing language barriers.
