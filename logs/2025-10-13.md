### Thing 1 (Transformation – AI-Assisted Intent Decoding)
**Plan:**  
Read a short article about AI helping noninvasive BCIs decode user intent more accurately.

**Goal:**  
See how AI + EEG enhancements improve speed and precision of BCI control.

**Reference:**  
- UCLA News: *AI co-pilot boosts noninvasive brain-computer interface by interpreting user intent*  
  https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ai-brain-computer-interface-interprets-user-intent-ucla

**Results (Summary):**
- AI models decode EEG signals to infer movement intention.  
- Using AI “co-pilot” speeds up user actions with BCIs.  
- This suggests noninvasive BCIs may approach more practical performance.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Microscale / Invisible Sensors)
**Plan:**  
Read about microscale sensors that fit between hair follicles for BCIs.

**Goal:**  
Understand how ultra-small sensors can improve wearable BCI comfort + stability.

**Reference:**  
- MedicalXpress: *Microscale brain–computer interface is small enough to be placed between hair follicles*  
  https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-microscale-braincomputer-interface-small-hair.html  
- Georgia Tech Research: *New Wearable Brain-Computer Interface*  
  https://research.gatech.edu/new-wearable-brain-computer-interface

**Results (Summary):**
- Sensors fit between hair, slightly under skin — boost signal quality and user comfort.  
- The new interface showed ~96.4% accuracy and stability for ~12 hours.  
- Wearables approach lab-level stability with minimal intrusion.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – BCI Restoring Speech in Paralysis)
**Plan:**  
Check a recent clinical BCI that helps a paralyzed person speak again via neural decoding.

**Goal:**  
See real-world impact of BCI tech in restoring communication.

**Reference:**  
- NIH / UCSF News: *Brain-computer interface restores natural speech after paralysis*  
  https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/brain-computer-interface-restores-natural-speech-after-paralysis

**Results (Summary):**
- BCI translated silent neural intent into audible words with very low delay.  
- Tests used electrodes + AI to map brain signals → voice in real time.  
- This tech could give voice back to people who can’t speak.
