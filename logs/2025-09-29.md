## Thing 1 (Transformation â€“ Signal Decoding & Algorithms)  
**Plan:**  
Look at how machine learning and deep learning are used to decode brain signals for BCI.  

**Resource:**  
Elashmawi, W.H. et al. (2024). *A Comprehensive Review on Brainâ€“Computer Interface (BCI)-Based Machine and Deep Learning Algorithms for Stroke Rehabilitation.* MDPI Applied Sciences, 14(14), 6347.

**Results:**  
- Traditional algorithms like **SVM (Support Vector Machines)** and **LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)** are widely used because they are fast and simple.  
- Deep learning methods (CNNs, RNNs, autoencoders) can capture more complex EEG patterns and are better for accuracy, but need more computing power and large datasets.  
- The review highlights a **trade-off**: ML is lightweight but less powerful, DL is more powerful but less practical for real-time rehab.

## Thing 2 (Transformation â€“ Applications & Use Cases)  
**Plan:**  
Examine stroke rehabilitation as a practical application.  

**Resource:**  
Same as Thing 1.  

**Results:**  
- EEG-BCI systems can detect motor imagery (thinking about moving a limb) and use that signal to control **robots, exoskeletons, or virtual avatars** for rehabilitation.  
- This helps retrain the brain and improve recovery for stroke patients.  
- **Current gaps:** Systems are slow, noisy, and not yet reliable for daily life use. They also require trained operators.  
- Promise: Combining AI with BCI could make rehab more personalized and effective.

## Thing 3 (Maintenance â€“ News & External Activity)  
**Plan:**  
Log this 2024 article as a new resource in our repo.  

**Resource:**  
Already cited above.  

**Results:**  
This review (2024) is valuable because it covers both **methods** and **applications** in one place, bridging the technical side (algorithms) and the clinical side (rehab). It shows how close we are to turning theory into practice but also how far we have to go in making these systems usable in everyday life.
