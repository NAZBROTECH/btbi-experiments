### Thing 1 (Transformation – Hybrid Signal Approaches)  
**Results:**  
Combining EEG (fast signals) with fNIRS (blood oxygen signals) creates a **hybrid BCI** that can capture both speed and reliability.  
MEG is too bulky, but research shows AI can sometimes approximate MEG-quality insights using EEG + smart models.  

💡 **Insight:** The future may not be one signal type — but **fusions** of multiple signals for richer brain data.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Personalized Stimulation Protocols)  
**Results:**  
- **tMS:** Often standardized (same coil placement for everyone).  
- **tDCS:** Early signs show **customized electrode placement** improves results.  
- **tFUS:** Being tested for tailoring to individual brain anatomy.  

💡 **Insight:** Personalization (AI + brain scans) could make stimulation safer and more effective than “one-size-fits-all.”

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Recent News)  
**Results:**  
In Sept 2025, Neuralink announced its **second human participant** received an implant and is testing motor-control features.  
This is part of their ongoing **clinical recruitment and validation program**.  

💡 **Insight:** Neuralink is moving slowly but steadily — scaling human trials one subject at a time.
