### Thing 1 (Transformation – Speech-Restoring BCIs)  
**Plan:**  
Read a short article about a recent brain-computer interface restoring speech for people with paralysis.  
**Goal:**  
Understand how BCIs are moving from movement restoration into full communication applications.  
**Reference:**  
- NIH Research Matters: *Brain-computer interface restores natural speech after paralysis* — https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/brain-computer-interface-restores-natural-speech-after-paralysis  
**Results (Summary):**  
- Describes a BCI system that translates brain activity into audible words for people who can’t speak.  
- Highlights reduction in latency (delay) improving conversational flow.  
- Shows signal decoding from speech-areas of the brain, not just movement.  
- 💡 *Insight:* The shift into communication signals (speech) is a major step for BCIs beyond simply “move a cursor or prosthetic”.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Haptic/Tactile Feedback in Neural Interfaces)  
**Plan:**  
Read a short article about how haptic feedback is being integrated into BCIs or prosthetics to give users sensation.  
**Goal:**  
Learn how sensory feedback is being addressed and why it matters for embodiment of devices.  
**Reference:**  
- UChicago Medicine: *Making prosthetic limbs feel more real with brain-computer interfaces* — https://news.uchicago.edu/story/making-prosthetic-limbs-feel-more-real-brain-computer-interfaces  
**Results (Summary):**  
- Reports on BCI systems that restore tactile feedback allowing users to “feel” their prosthetic limb.  
- Suggests improved control and user satisfaction when sensory feedback is present.  
- Illustrates that motor control alone is not enough for a device to feel integrated.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Designing BCIs/prosthetics must consider bidirectional flow: brain → device AND device → brain for true “embodiment”.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Ethics & Regulation in Neuro-Tech)  
**Plan:**  
Read a short article about regulatory or ethical issues surrounding BCIs and neural data.  
**Goal:**  
Stay aware of emerging governance, privacy, consent and use-case boundaries in neuro-technology.  
**Reference:**  
- STAT News: *Brain implant captures speech tone, pitch through analyzing activity* — https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/19/brain-computer-interface-als-communication-new-study-patient-voice-restored-after-implant/  
**Results (Summary):**  
- Describes a BCI that restores speech including tone and pitch for a person with ALS.  
- Raises questions about accuracy, user autonomy, data privacy, and unforeseen consequences.  
- Emphasizes that neuro-signals are sensitive biometric data and require careful handling.  
- 💡 *Insight:* As BCIs enable communication and sensation, ethical/regulatory frameworks must keep pace to ensure user rights and safety.
