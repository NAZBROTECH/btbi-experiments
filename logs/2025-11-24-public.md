### Topic 1 – Learning from DIY EEG Failure

Summary:  
This article tells the story of someone building a DIY EEG from scratch using low-cost electronics. Despite initial success, the system failed due to weak signals, noise, latency, and instability. The project taught the author that real neurotech is extremely hard and requires far more precision and engineering than expected.

Insight:  
For Synapse, this reinforces our approach: by using synthetic data, we avoid misleading users into thinking cheap EEG can read deep cognition. Modeling noise and failure modes teaches realism and protects against hype.

### Topic 2 – Synapse Integration: Realistic Failure Modes  
Plan:  
1. Add a “DIY EEG Failure Lessons” section to README.md  
2. Extend the simulator to include failure modes (dropout, jitter, saturation)  
3. Add demo script diy_failure_sim.py showing how signals fail under real-world conditions

Insight:  
Simulating failure teaches humility and scientific accuracy. Synapse becomes a learning tool that shows why real BCIs are hard — not a hype machine.
