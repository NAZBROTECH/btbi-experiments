# 🧠 Synapse Development Log – 2025-10-27 (Public-Safe)

### Thing 1 (Transformation – Low-Resource Prototype Pathways & Community Builds)
**Plan:**  
Survey short, accessible writeups and practical how-tos for beginning BCI work with minimal resources; integrate the Muse-2 Part-2 guide as an actionable reference for safe, consumer-grade data capture workflows.

**Goal:**  
Validate a Lagos-feasible, simulation-first approach and capture concrete, low-risk procedures for consumer EEG data collection (streaming, recording, labeling) suitable for model development without invasive hardware.

**Results (Summary):**  
- Confirms safe, low-cost entry routes: (1) simulation-first R&D using open EEG datasets and synthetic signals; (2) consumer EEG capture using devices like Muse-2 for low-bandwidth prototypes (attention, intent commands).  
- Part-2 (Muse-2) provides practical guidance for BLE streaming, session calibration, and data export formats useful for an intermediate (L2) pipeline.  
- Emphasizes repeated calibration, a consistent recording environment, and careful annotation to improve model utility from consumer devices.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Use Part-2’s streaming/export practices to standardize Lagos data collection sessions and produce reliable training batches for the Neural Decoder Core.

### Thing 2 (Creation – AI Neural Decoder Core: Stage 1 — Data Labeling for Intent Commands)
**Plan:**  
Design a data labeling scheme for intent commands (Yes, No, Select, Cancel) using consumer EEG recordings and simulated data.

**Goal:**  
Produce a reproducible L2 pipeline: BLE stream → Python SDK → preprocessing → labeled dataset ready for model training.

**Results (Summary):**  
- Proposed labeling protocol: short cue epochs (2–4s) per command, interleaved rest periods, 20–30 trials per session, 5+ sessions per participant across days.  
- Preprocessing checklist: bandpass filtering (recommended 1–40 Hz), notch removal (50/60 Hz as applicable), artefact rejection (blink/muscle epochs), epoching and baseline correction.  
- File formats & tooling: recommend CSV/EDF exports and Python toolkits (mne-python for preprocessing, PyTorch/TensorFlow for model prototyping).  
- 💡 *Insight:* Combine consumer EEG captures with synthetic augmentation (time-warp, noise injection) to increase training robustness before moving to higher-quality hardware.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Pilot Use Case: Mental-Health Assist + Education in Lagos)
**Plan:**  
Outline a conservative pilot using consumer EEG devices and cloud AI to monitor attention/stress and deliver benign adaptive feedback for student volunteers.

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate user value, gather consented datasets, and validate ethical practices while operating within institutional oversight.

**Results (Summary):**  
- Pilot parameters: cohort N ≤ 20, informed consent, IRB or local ethics oversight, consumer headsets (Muse-2 or similar), daily sessions of 15–20 minutes.  
- AI function: classify attention/arousal and deliver simple, non-invasive feedback (breathing prompts, study pacing cues). Model updates via federated or local training to reduce raw data centralization.  
- Governance: clear consent tokens, encrypted storage, immediate opt-out, participant transparency reports.  
- 💡 *Insight:* A well-run pilot builds community trust and creates ethically collected, labeled data suitable for improving the Neural Decoder Core.
