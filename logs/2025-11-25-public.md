Summary:  
The article walks through creating a neurogame using the Muse 2 EEG headset: capturing attention and relaxation signals, mapping them to game mechanics (e.g., moving an object or scoring based on focus), and building a simple Unity interface. It notes challenges like latency, calibration, signal drift, and the limited bandwidth of consumer EEG devices.

Insight:  
For Synapse, this shows a practical entry-point: Using consumer EEG hardware for low-bandwidth interactive experiences. While our focus remains synthetic simulation, we can build a parallel 
neurogame
prototype module demonstrating how simulated signals could map to interactive actions — helping users understand how real-world EEG ties into fun & practical applications.

### Topic 2 – Synapse Integration: Neurogame Module & Simulation Path  
Plan:  
1. Create a module 
eurogame_sim.py in modules/ that simulates attention and relaxation signals (e.g., two channels) and a simple JSON output of game-state.  
2. Add a demo script un_neurogame_sim.py that prints simulated signal values and shows how they might control a game object (e.g., object_x
-=
attention_level).  
3. Document in README under Neurogame
Prototype how Synapse supports both educational simulation **and** a consumer-EEG style fun scenario — emphasizing simulation not live hardware.

Insight:  
By adding a neurogame simulation path, Synapse broadens its appeal: learners can see how brain-signal simulation *can* tie into interaction without needing expensive or invasive hardware. This also builds a bridge from synthetic signals to prototyping playful experiences — reinforcing education, not hype.
