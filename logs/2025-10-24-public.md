# 🧠 Synapse Development Log – 2025-10-24 (Public-Safe)

### Thing 1 (Transformation – Low-Resource Prototype Pathways & Community Builds)
**Plan:**  
Survey short writeups on how students and hobbyists start BCI projects with limited resources (simulation-first, consumer EEG devices, community labs).

**Goal:**  
Map safe, simulation-first steps that can be run from Lagos: synthetic signal generation, model training in cloud, and community-sourced consumer EEG units for benign sensing tasks.

**Results (Summary):**  
- Two safe entry paths: (1) simulation-first R&D using open datasets and synthetic signals; (2) benign sensing prototypes using consumer EEG for low-bandwidth tasks (attention detection, simple commands).  
- Community labs and student teams are a good source of skills and low-cost components.  
- Most student projects avoid invasive hardware and use vendor SDKs — a safe route.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Prioritize digital simulations and cloud model training before hardware procurement.

### Thing 2 (Creation – AI Neural Decoder Core)
**Plan:**  
Draft a high-level architecture for an AI Neural Decoder Core focused on simulation and cloud testing (non-hardware-specific).

**Goal:**  
Define the data pipeline: signal simulation → preprocessing → feature extraction → model decoding → policy gating.

**Results (Summary):**  
- Pipeline: Raw signals (or simulated data) → preprocessing (filtering, artifact removal) → feature extraction → ML-based decoder → packaged output routed to policy layer.  
- Use federated learning or simulated federated updates to avoid centralizing sensitive data.  
- Start with public EEG datasets and open-source toolkits to prototype models without hardware.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Building robust simulation and federated model pipelines allows proof-of-concept before any physical prototypes are sought.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Pilot Use Case: Mental-Health Assist + Education)
**Plan:**  
Outline a low-risk pilot in Lagos using non-invasive consumer EEG and cloud AI to monitor attention/stress and deliver adaptive feedback.

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate value, gather consented datasets, and validate ethical practices.

**Results (Summary):**  
- Pilot design: small volunteer cohort, informed consent, supervised by local ethics review.  
- Use consumer headsets for non-invasive measurement (attention/arousal) and cloud models to classify states.  
- Provide benign, immediate feedback (breathing exercises, prompts) and ensure data governance.  
- 💡 *Insight:* A well-run pilot can attract academic partners and grants, and advance the project without requiring advanced lab resources.
