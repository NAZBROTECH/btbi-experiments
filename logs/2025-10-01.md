### Thing 1 (Transformation – BCI Signals Deep Dive)  
**Results:**  
EEG is cheap, portable, and has great timing accuracy (you can see brain activity changes in milliseconds). But it has poor spatial accuracy (you can’t tell exactly which brain area the signal came from) and it’s noisy.  

fNIRS is also portable and adds spatial information (measures blood oxygen), but it’s much slower — signals lag by several seconds because blood flow is slower than electrical signals.  

MEG has both excellent timing and spatial accuracy, but it’s extremely expensive, massive in size, and requires a special shielded room. This makes it impractical for everyday human use.  

?? **Insight:** Combining EEG (fast timing) and fNIRS (spatial info) could give results closer to MEG, but in a portable, human-friendly way.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – CBI Stimulation Deep Dive)  
**Results:**  
- **tMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation):** Well-studied, safe, and non-invasive. Good for research. But it has limited depth (can’t reach very deep brain areas) and can feel uncomfortable.  
- **tDCS (Direct Current Stimulation):** Simple, cheap, and safe. But weak and imprecise — can’t target specific areas very well.  
- **tFUS (Focused Ultrasound):** New method. Promising because it can go deep and target areas very precisely. But scientists are still figuring out exactly how it works and whether it’s safe long-term.  

?? **Insight:** None of these methods alone is “enough.” A future device might need to combine them (or improve them) for true brain-to-brain communication.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Recent News)  
**Results:**  
Neuralink has opened its **Patient Registry** for clinical trials. This means people can officially sign up to be considered for testing the Neuralink implant. It’s a big step because it moves from animal studies into human recruitment.  

?? **Insight:** This confirms the field is advancing into *real-world application*, not just theory. Neuralink’s trial focuses on medical use (helping paralyzed patients), but it also sets the stage for future broader applications.
