### Thing 1 (Transformation â€“ Signal Quality & Noise Handling)  
**Results:**  
Brain signals (EEG especially) are very **noisy** because muscles, blinking, and outside electronics interfere.  
Scientists use **filters and algorithms** to clean up signals, but itâ€™s still a big challenge.  
fNIRS helps by adding oxygenation data, but itâ€™s slow.  
MEG is clean but too expensive and bulky for daily use.  

ðŸ’¡ **Insight:** Improving signal processing (AI filters, hybrid methods) may be the biggest step toward practical BCIs.

### Thing 2 (Transformation â€“ Safety in Stimulation Methods)  
**Results:**  
- **tMS:** Generally safe but can trigger mild side effects like headaches or discomfort.  
- **tDCS:** Considered very safe at low currents, but effects are weak.  
- **tFUS:** Still being studied, but unknown long-term risks (especially if repeated often).  

ðŸ’¡ **Insight:** For B2BI to be mainstream, safety must be guaranteed for daily use â€” which is harder than just proving it works once in a lab.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance â€“ Recent News)  
**Results:**  
In 2024, a startup called **Precision Neuroscience** (founded by a Neuralink co-founder) began testing its **thin electrode implant** called the *Layer 7 Cortical Interface*.  
Unlike Neuralink, it is designed to sit on the brain surface (less invasive).  

ðŸ’¡ **Insight:** Competition is growing â€” multiple companies are pursuing different strategies to solve the same problem.
