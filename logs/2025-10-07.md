### Thing 1 (Transformation – Neural Decoding Advances)
**Plan:**  
Read one short, clear news piece about recent brain-decoding advances (inner speech / “thought-to-text” experiments).

**Goal:**  
Understand what recent AI+BCI experiments can decode today (what worked, how accurate, and the main caveats).

**Reference:**  
- Short news summary: New brain implant can decode a person's "inner monologue" (LiveScience).
  https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/new-brain-implant-can-decode-a-persons-inner-monologue

**Results (Summary):**
- Recent studies (with implanted electrodes + AI) can decode inner speech or silent speech into words/phrases.
- Lab systems showed promising accuracy in constrained tests; useful for communication-restoration.
- Caveats: invasive hardware required, limited vocab/context, privacy concerns.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Wearable / Consumer BCIs)
**Plan:**  
Read a short university/industry note on wearable BCIs and dry-electrode headsets.

**Goal:**  
See what is available now that's wearable and fast to try (no messy gel), and note practical limits.

**Reference:**  
- Georgia Tech Neuro summary: New wearable BCI.
  https://neuro.gatech.edu/new-wearable-brain-computer-interface

**Results (Summary):**
- Wearables with dry electrodes shorten setup time and allow many quick experiments.
- Good for simple control tasks and learning signal processing; not yet for high-bandwidth decoding.
- Practical for prototyping and user testing.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Neuralink / Patient Registry)
**Plan:**  
Check Neuralink's official patient-registry update.

**Goal:**  
Confirm status of human trials and how people can express interest.

**Reference:**  
- Neuralink updates — Patient Registry announcement.
  https://neuralink.com/updates/announcing-neuralink-s-patient-registry/

**Results (Summary):**
- Patient registry open for volunteers; indicates clinical recruitment step.
- Focus remains medical: restoring movement/communication; not consumer telepathy yet.
