### Thing 1 (Transformation – Brain-Computer Interface in Stroke Rehab)  
**Plan:**  
Read a short article about how BCIs are being used in stroke rehabilitation.  
**Goal:**  
Understand how BCI systems help patients recover motor function and communicate.  
**Reference:**  
- “Stroke-recovery device using brain-computer interface receives FDA market authorization” – Washington University Medicine  
  https://medicine.washu.edu/news/stroke-recovery-device-using-brain-computer-interface-receives-fda-market-authorization/  
**Results (Summary):**  
- A BCI-powered device (IpsiHand) has been authorized to aid stroke patients by linking brain signals to a hand-exoskeleton.  
- Demonstrates real-world medical deployment of BCI, beyond lab experiments.  
- Highlights: improved motor movement in chronic stroke survivors; the need for sustained training and neuroplasticity leverage.  
- Caveats: still focused on upper limb recovery; integration into everyday therapy remains ongoing.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Consumer Neurogaming Tech)  
**Plan:**  
Read a short piece about neurotech in gaming and wearables.  
**Goal:**  
See how BCI and brain-wave sensing are moving into entertainment and consumer tech.  
**Reference:**  
- “Neurable’s brainwave-tracking Master & Dynamic headphones tell you when to take a break” – Engadget  
  https://www.engadget.com/neurables-brainwave-tracking-master--dynamic-headphones-tell-you-when-to-take-a-break-120004736.html  
**Results (Summary):**  
- EEG sensors integrated into consumer headphones to detect focus, track brain-waves for user feedback.  
- Indicates BCI elements are entering the mass-market via accessible hardware.  
- Yet: functionality remains limited (focus/relaxation tracking) rather than full mind-control.  
- Insight: Good prototype stage for wearables; significant gap remains to full B2BI performance.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Brain Signal Privacy & Liability)  
**Plan:**  
Read a short article about legal risks and liability when brain-data is used commercially.  
**Goal:**  
Note what companies & users need to watch out for when brain signals are collected in real-life settings.  
**Reference:**  
- “Brainwaves Hacked Using Consumer Grade EEG Headsets” – SciTechDaily  
  https://scitechdaily.com/brainwaves-hacked-using-consumer-grade-eeg-headsets/  
**Results (Summary):**  
- Demonstrates that even consumer EEG headsets can reveal sensitive information (PINs, personal attributes) via brain-wave patterns.  
- Raises data-privacy concerns: brain-signal leakage, consent issues, potential misuse in neurotech.  
- Suggests regulation and user awareness are lagging behind tech deployment.
