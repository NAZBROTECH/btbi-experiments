# üß† Synapse Development Log ‚Äì 2025-10-31 (Public-Safe)

### Topic 1 ‚Äì Real-Time Motor Imagery Simulation Framework
**Plan:**  
Extend the workflow into simulated ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù motor imagery scenarios using the Part 5 article as reference.  
Design a virtual streaming pipeline that mimics low-latency classification of synthetic EEG commands such as ‚Äúleft hand imagery‚Äù, ‚Äúright hand imagery‚Äù, or ‚Äúrest‚Äù.

**Reference:**  
- Medium (Part 5): *Real-Time Motor Imagery Predictions with a Bedroom BCI System* ‚Äî https://medium.com/building-a-bedroom-bci/real-time-motor-imagery-predictions-with-a-bedroom-bci-system-8db20fb7c36a  
- Previous resources: Parts 3 & 4 (pre-processing & ML simulation)  

**Summary:**  
- The article demonstrates how to stream consumer EEG data, aggregate windows (e.g., 3 s), apply trained models, and update output in real-time. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- It reports modest performance but emphasises the educational value of full-stack observation from signal capture ‚Üí real-time inference. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Key focus: latency constraints, buffer management, state stability in continuous classification loops.

**Insight:**  
A real-time simulation provides useful architecture experience. For Synapse we can safely emulate this pipeline purely with synthetic streams, building our timing and decision-loop logic ahead of any hardware interface.

### Topic 2 ‚Äì Virtual Stream Prototype in Python
**Plan:**  
Build a ‚Äúdata generator ‚Üí classifier ‚Üí output loop‚Äù that runs on a fixed timestep (e.g., every 0.3 s), simulates motor-imagery predictive outputs, and logs system latency and state transitions.

**Summary:**  
- Use NumPy to generate synthetic features (e.g., 0.0‚Äì1.0 range), simulate windows of size 30 samples at 10 Hz.  
- Feed into a toy classifier (RandomForest or SVM) pre-trained on synthetic labels.  
- Log timestamp, prediction, latency metrics, and state changes (‚Äúleft‚Äù, ‚Äúright‚Äù, ‚Äúnone‚Äù).  
- Graph results using Matplotlib; assess average latency and mis-classification of rapid state changes.

**Insight:**  
By the time we introduce real EEG front ends, the simulator will tell us whether our loop architecture meets responsiveness requirements.

### Topic 3 ‚Äì Ethical Simulation Boundaries & Educational Use
**Plan:**  
Ensure our simulation stays fully transparent: all data synthetic or openly licensed, no personal identifiers, clarity that this is educational and not a clinical system.

**Summary:**  
- Label classes clearly as synthetic ‚Äúmotor imagery states‚Äù, not real neurological intent.  
- Publish simulation code openly with comments about ethical use and consent when real hardware arrives.  
- Outline disclaimers and review guidelines for eventual community sharing.

**Insight:**  
Building the simulation first preserves ethical integrity, gives trust, and aligns with public-safe documentation strategy.
