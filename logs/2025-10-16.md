### Thing 1 (Transformation – Real-Time Speech via BCI)
**Plan:**  
Read about a BCI that translates brain activity into audible speech.

**Goal:**  
See how close we are to restoring voice for those who can’t speak.

**Reference:**  
- UC Davis / NIH: *Brain-computer interface restores natural speech after paralysis*  
  https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/brain-computer-interface-restores-natural-speech-after-paralysis

**Results (Summary):**
- This BCI translates brain signals into voice in real time, reducing lag.  
- Helps people with speech loss communicate fluidly.  
- Uses implanted electrodes + AI signal decoding.  
- Important step toward assistive communication devices.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Wireless & Micro BCIs)
**Plan:**  
Study a wireless BCI and a wearable microstructure BCI.

**Goal:**  
Understand how BCI can become less invasive and more comfortable.

**Reference(s):**  
- University of Michigan: *First in-human recording of wireless BCI*  
  https://www.michiganmedicine.org/news-release/university-michigan-team-leads-first-human-recording-new-wireless-brain-computer-interface  
- Georgia Tech: *New wearable microstructure BCI sensor*  
  https://research.gatech.edu/new-wearable-brain-computer-interface

**Results (Summary):**
- The Michigan team implanted a wireless BCI with 421 microelectrodes to record human brain signals.  
- Georgia Tech built a sensor that fits between hair follicles, improving wearability.  
- Both advances reduce the bulk and invasiveness of BCI hardware.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Neural Data Privacy & Regulation)
**Plan:**  
Look at how governments are responding to privacy issues in BCI.

**Goal:**  
See what legal steps are being taken to protect neural data.

**Reference:**  
- Article: *Senators call for investigation into BCI privacy*  
  https://www.medtechdive.com/news/senators-bci-brain-computer-privacy-ftc/746733

**Results (Summary):**
- U.S. senators asked the FTC to investigate how neurotech companies handle neural data.  
- Concern is that companies are collecting too much brain data without clear protections.  
- This is a sign that regulation is catching up with technology.
