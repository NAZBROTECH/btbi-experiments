## Thing 1 (Transformation – Deep Dive on Methods)

### Plan:
Expand on BCI + CBI methods from Nam et al. (2021).
Compare EEG vs fNIRS vs MEG for signal capture, and tMS vs tDCS vs tFUS for stimulation.
Goal: Identify which combinations are most promising for non-invasive human B2BI.

### Results:
**Signal Capture (BCI side)**
- EEG: Cheap, portable, widely used, excellent temporal resolution; but poor spatial resolution and noisy.
- fNIRS: Portable, provides blood-oxygenation spatial info; slower, several seconds lag.
- MEG: High spatial + temporal resolution; but extremely costly, requires shielded room.

➡️ Most promising: EEG + fNIRS hybrid → EEG for speed, fNIRS for spatial detail.

**Stimulation (CBI side)**
- tMS: Reliable, non-invasive, well-studied; limited depth and can be uncomfortable.
- tDCS: Simple, cheap, safe; low precision and weak effects.
- tFUS: Emerging, deep penetration, high spatial selectivity; mechanisms still under study.

➡️ Most promising: tFUS (future) combined with tMS (established).

**Conclusion:**  
For non-invasive human B2BI, the likely best combination is **EEG + fNIRS (capture) with tFUS (stimulation)**, though EEG + tMS remains the practical option today.

## Thing 2 (Transformation – Applications & Use Cases)

### Plan:
Map real-world applications mentioned in literature (rehab, locked-in patients, military, collaborative problem-solving).
Build a small table of “Application → Current State → Gaps.”

### Results:

| Application               | Current State (2021–2025)                      | Gaps / Challenges                  |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Locked-in patient comms    | EEG → binary yes/no via BCI + CBI             | Too slow, low bandwidth, ethical/privacy issues |
| Stroke rehab               | Brain-triggered stimulation of muscles        | Needs more clinical trials, patient variability |
| Military / security comms  | Conceptual only                               | Privacy, ethics, potential misuse   |
| Collaborative problem-solving | Simple tasks (guessing games, binary decisions) | Scaling to complex ideas not possible yet |
| Cross-species control      | Human → rodent/cockroach proof-of-concept     | Ethical concerns, not practical for humans |

**Conclusion:**  
Applications exist in early proof-of-concept, but **bandwidth and ethics** are the biggest barriers to scaling up.

## Thing 3 (Maintenance – News & External Activity)

### Plan:
Find one new 2024–2025 news article on B2BI/BCI.

### Results:

**New Source:**  
Neuralink plans brain implant trial for speech impairments (Reuters, Sept 19, 2025)  
Link: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/elon-musks-neuralink-plans-brain-implant-trial-speech-impairments-2025-09-19

**Summary:**
- Neuralink will begin a clinical trial in October 2025 to convert imagined speech into text for people with paralysis.
- Device received FDA Breakthrough Device designation for faster review.
- Participants: individuals who lost ability to speak due to injury or disease.
- Builds on decoding “inner speech” brain signals.

**Connection to Thing 1 & 2:**
- Extends the BCI → CBI model from Thing 1, applied directly to communication.  
- Fits the “locked-in patient” use case identified in Thing 2.  
- Still invasive (implants), showing the gap between speculative “no-interface” BTBI and current hardware-dependent approaches.
