### Thing 1 (Transformation – Speech Synthesis BCIs)
**Plan:**  
Read about BCIs that convert neural signals into speech in real time.

**Goal:**  
Understand how AI turns brain signals into spoken language and what challenges remain.

**Reference:**  
- [A New BCI Instantly Synthesizes Speech – IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/bci-speech-synthesis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Results (Summary):**
- BCIs can now decode signals from the speech motor cortex to generate near-instant vocal output.  
- Improves communication for people with paralysis or loss of speech.  
- Still limited in vocabulary, clarity, and requires invasive implants.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Combining language models with neural decoding could make “thought-to-speech” seamless in future.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Gesture-Based Interfaces)
**Plan:**  
Explore how wearable BCIs interpret wrist or hand signals for control.

**Goal:**  
See how electrical activity from muscles and nerves can control digital devices.

**Reference:**  
- [Meta’s New Bracelet Reads Hand Gestures – IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/meta-wristband-interface?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Results (Summary):**
- Meta’s EMG wristband detects electrical impulses in arm muscles to infer hand gestures.  
- Allows silent control of AR/VR devices with subtle finger motions.  
- Practical, non-invasive, and easy to wear — ideal for consumer applications.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Gesture decoding may bridge the gap between neural signals and real-world interaction.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Neurotechnology & Ethics)
**Plan:**  
Read a short piece about ethical and social concerns in workplace neurotech.

**Goal:**  
Understand how brain monitoring in workplaces could raise privacy and autonomy issues.

**Reference:**  
- [Neurotechnology Could Revolutionize Work—But It Comes with Ethical Risks – Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91256406/neurotechnology-revolutionize-work-ethical-risks-workers?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Results (Summary):**
- Companies are exploring neurotech for focus tracking and productivity enhancement.  
- Raises serious ethical questions: consent, data ownership, and cognitive freedom.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Regulation will be key to ensuring neurotech enhances, not exploits, workers.
