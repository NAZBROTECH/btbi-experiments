Summary:  
This article explores how phototransduction (the retinal conversion of light into neural signals) enables vision, and how EEG-based BCIs attempt to detect visual-evoked signals.  
It emphasizes the gap between biological resolution and EEG resolution, while highlighting SSVEP and other entrainment techniques for vision-response estimation.

Insight:  
For Synapse, phototransduction biology informs our ongoing strategy to create synthetic “vision response” signals ethically — without real neural recordings. This advances the vision-simulation roadmap.

### Topic 2 – Synapse Integration (Vision Simulation Module)
Plan:
1. Add a ision_sim.py module combining light-intensity modulation + SSVEP-style entrainment.  
2. Integrate it into the simulation toolkit as an experimental vision-response generator.  
3. Expand documentation with diagrams of the phototransduction → EEG synthetic pipeline.

Insight:  
A synthetic vision-response system allows experimentation without compromising ethics or real neural data safety.
