# 🧠 Synapse Development Log – 2025-10-23

### Thing 1 (Transformation – AI in Neural Signal Decoding)  
**Plan:**  
Read a short article about how AI technologies are being used to interpret brain signals for next-gen BCIs.  
**Goal:**  
Identify methods we can incorporate into Synaose’s AI Neural Decoder Core to translate thoughts into usable data.  
**Reference:**  
- Medium: *Introduction to Brain-Computer Interfaces* — https://medium.com/data-science/introduction-to-brain-computer-interfaces-d05d533e3543 :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
**Results (Summary):**  
- Explains how BCIs collect brain signals (invasive vs non-invasive) and how AI/ML is used to classify mental states. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Highlights challenge: low signal-to-noise ratio in non-invasive systems.  
- Mentions feature extraction and classification pipelines where machine learning models decode brain patterns.  
- 💡 *Insight:* For the AI Neural Decoder Core, we need a strong feature-extraction algorithm and adaptive ML model that learns each user’s brain signature.

### Thing 2 (Creation – Designing the AI Neural Decoder Core)  
**Plan:**  
Define how Synaose’s AI Neural Decoder Core will process neural inputs, decode intended thought/message, and prepare it for communication.  
**Goal:**  
Build a clear conceptual map of how the Core translates user brain signals into sharable payloads while maintaining speed and accuracy.  
**Results (Summary):**  
- The AI Neural Decoder Core will receive raw signals from the Main Core, perform preprocessing (filtering, artefact removal), then apply user-specific ML model to decode intent.  
- After decoding, the Core packages the “thought payload” and sends it to the Filter Core for encryption and sharing.  
- We’ll design a feedback loop: the system monitors success of decoded messages and retrains the model to improve accuracy over time.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Establishing the pipeline (Signal → Preprocess → Decode → Package) early allows us to prototype in simulation without hardware. We can use open datasets in Nigeria/remote for initial training.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Ethical & Real-World Use Case: AI-Stress Monitoring in Synapse)  
**Plan:**  
Investigate a short article about how AI is being used for stress/emotion monitoring from brain signals in real-world settings.  
**Goal:**  
Understand a practical use-case for Synaose beyond “communication” — in this case, mental-health monitoring embedded in the system.  
**Reference:**  
- Bitbrain Blog: *What is BCI? An introduction to brain-computer interface using EEG signals* — https://www.bitbrain.com/blog/brain-computer-interface-using-eeg-signals :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
**Results (Summary):**  
- Describes EEG-based BCIs for classification of cognitive or emotional states (stress, fatigue) using ML. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Highlights that non-invasive, lower-cost systems can still detect meaningful brain patterns for everyday use.  
- Presents the idea of “assistive” BCI not just for movement but for monitoring and wellbeing.  
- 💡 *Insight:* For Synaose, embedding an AI stress/emotion-monitoring module as part of the system adds value and gives a practical application while we build the full communication capability.
