### Thing 1 (Transformation – Cognitive Signal Adaptation)  
**Findings:**  
- Adaptive BCIs monitor **changes in brain patterns** (like theta or alpha waves) to detect **fatigue, stress, or loss of focus**.  
- When the system senses poor attention, it can **auto-adjust classifier thresholds** or increase feedback sensitivity to maintain performance.  
- Machine-learning models (especially reinforcement learning) are being used to let BCIs **learn from the user over time**, improving signal reliability.  

**Insight:**  
The future of BCIs isn’t just reading the brain—it’s *learning with* the brain. Adaptive algorithms make interfaces more personalized and resilient to day-to-day mental fluctuations.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Closed-Loop Feedback Systems)  
**Findings:**  
- Closed-loop neuromodulation uses **real-time neural feedback** to control stimulation rather than applying fixed pulses.  
- Systems like **tFUS and tMS** adjust parameters dynamically depending on measured brain activity.  
- This results in **greater precision, fewer side effects, and faster behavioral adaptation** compared to open-loop methods.  

**Insight:**  
Closed-loop systems mark the transition from “stimulate and observe” to **“observe and adapt.”** They enable self-correcting brain-device ecosystems.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Industry & Research Update)  
**Findings:**  
- **Neuralink** continues limited human trials focusing on patients with severe paralysis, collecting long-term stability data.  
- **Synchron** expanded its trial base in the U.S. and Australia, working on regulatory milestones toward broader implantation.  
- Both firms emphasize **communication restoration** as the first commercial goal, not enhancement.  

**Insight:**  
Competition between Neuralink and Synchron is accelerating the medical BCI field’s maturity, making regulatory pathways and clinical standards clearer for future entrants.
