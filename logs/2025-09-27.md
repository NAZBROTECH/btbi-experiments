### Thing 1 (Transformation ‚Äì Recap of Methods & Chip Sketch)  
**Results:**  
- EEG: Cheap, portable, temporal resolution strong, poor spatial, noisy.  
- fNIRS: Portable, spatial (blood oxygen), slow (seconds lag).  
- MEG: High temporal + spatial, costly, massive, shielded rooms.  
‚û°Ô∏è EEG + fNIRS complement each other; MEG is ideal but impractical.  
- CBI:  
  - TMS = reliable, non-invasive, shallow depth, uncomfortable.  
  - tDCS = cheap, safe, low precision, weak.  
  - tFUS = new, deep penetration, precise, under study.  
‚û°Ô∏è None alone are complete.  
- Chip sketch: Sender ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Receiver cores in cerebrum for telepathy.  
- B2BI flow: Person A EEG ‚Üí TMS ‚Üí Person B ‚Üí reply back same way.

### Thing 2 (Transformation ‚Äì Application Case)  
**Results:**  
- Application: EEG to detect brain states (active, relax, meditate, sleep).  
- Usefulness: Helps detect seizures, epilepsy, stroke.  
- Limitation: Can‚Äôt detect detailed *thoughts*, only general states.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance ‚Äì Resource Update)  
**Results:**  
- Resource: Pouya Vakilipour et al. 2024 ‚Äì *Brain-to-brain interface technology: A brief history, current state, and future goals* ([PubMed 38711277](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38711277/))  
- Summary: Review of BBI systems (reading + writing brain signals). Shows current uses (rehab, locked-in syndrome, cross-species links) and highlights technical + ethical challenges.
