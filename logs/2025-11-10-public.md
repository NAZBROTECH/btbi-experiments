# 🧠 Synapse Development Log – 2025-11-10 (Public-Safe)

### Topic 1 – Introduction to Computational Neuroscience

Summary:
This article introduces the interdisciplinary field of computational neuroscience, which connects biology, mathematics, and computer science to understand how the brain processes information.
It explains how simple neuron models, such as the Hodgkin–Huxley or integrate-and-fire models, help researchers simulate and analyze neural activity in a mathematically safe and ethical way.

Insight:
Understanding neural computation through simulation—not real brain data—builds both safety and accessibility into early-stage BCI education.
Synapse can use such computational frameworks for synthetic modeling and signal testing before exploring physical interfaces.

### Topic 2 – Practical Pathways for Learning
Summary:
The article outlines key skills and tools required to grow in computational neuroscience:
- Python programming with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Brian2.
- Knowledge of linear algebra and differential equations.
- Familiarity with open datasets and simulation tools instead of direct neural collection.

Insight:
Adopting these open and transparent learning methods ensures Synapse’s experiments remain reproducible and educational rather than invasive.

### Topic 3 – Synapse Integration Plan
Plan:
1. Build a small Python simulation script using numpy and matplotlib to visualize conceptual neuron firing rates.
2. Add a “Learning Module” section to documentation linking theoretical neuroscience to Synapse’s simulated EEG pipeline.
3. Keep all data synthetic and all parameters fully open-source.
