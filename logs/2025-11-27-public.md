Summary:  
This article provides a deep scientific explanation of synaptic transmission — the biological process that enables neurons to communicate. It explains how electrical impulses trigger calcium-dependent vesicle fusion, neurotransmitter release, and receptor activation in the postsynaptic neuron. The process involves precise biochemical regulation, making it essential for cognition, learning, and healthy neural function.

Key ideas include action potentials, ion-channel activity, vesicle docking, receptor binding, excitatory vs inhibitory signaling, and the impact of synaptic strength on neural circuits. Even small disruptions can impair memory, cognition, or neural communication.

Insight:  
For Synapse, this reinforces that real neural communication is complex, chemical, and variable. Synapse cannot model biological synapse chemistry, but it can incorporate the consequences of synaptic variability — noise, jitter, drift, and unreliability. This supports Synapse's mission as a realistic educational simulation rather than a biological model.

### Topic 2 – Synapse Strategy: Expanding Implant-Like & Biological Constraint Modeling
Plan:  
1. Extend the implant-constraint simulator with timing jitter and amplitude variability inspired by real synapses.  
2. Add a mode simulating gradual reliability drift, reflecting biological changes over time.  
3. Update documentation to clarify the distinction between biological synaptic transmission and what Synapse models.  
4. Begin designing a new module \simulate_failure_modes.py\ to teach real-world failure scenarios.

Insight:  
Synapse benefits scientifically and ethically from modeling limitations, variability, and failure modes. This keeps expectations realistic and strengthens its role as an educational tool.
