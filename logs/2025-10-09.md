### Thing 1 (Transformation – Portable BCIs)
**Plan:**  
Read a short, clear summary about how portable and wearable BCIs are evolving.

**Goal:**  
Understand how engineers are shrinking brain-computer interfaces into consumer-grade devices.

**Reference:**  
- IEEE Spectrum: How brain-computer interfaces are becoming wearable.  
  https://spectrum.ieee.org/wearable-bci-headsets

**Results (Summary):**
- Engineers are focusing on comfort, wireless data links, and dry-electrode designs.  
- Wearables trade some signal quality for convenience and accessibility.  
- Current consumer BCIs enable meditation tracking, basic control, and neurofeedback.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Brain Stimulation Safety)
**Plan:**  
Review a short safety article on transcranial electrical stimulation (tES).

**Goal:**  
Note key safety principles and what scientists monitor in noninvasive stimulation.

**Reference:**  
- Frontiers: Safety of transcranial electrical stimulation.  
  https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00031/full

**Results (Summary):**
- Low-current tES is generally safe when properly supervised.  
- Side effects are mild (tingling, skin irritation).  
- Long-term studies show no brain damage at research-level doses.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Neuralink Recruitment Update)
**Plan:**  
Check the latest Neuralink recruitment or clinical trial update.

**Goal:**  
Confirm current participant opportunities or milestones.

**Reference:**  
- Neuralink official update – Patient registry & recruitment page.  
  https://neuralink.com/updates/announcing-neuralink-s-patient-registry/

**Results (Summary):**
- Neuralink continues accepting patient volunteers for motor impairment trials.  
- The first human implant milestone was achieved, showing functional communication restoration.  
- Public interest is growing toward next-phase participants.
