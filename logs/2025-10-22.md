# 🧠 Synapse Development Log – 2025-10-22

### Thing 1 (Transformation – Neural Encryption & Secure Brain Signals)  
**Plan:**  
Read about how researchers are working to encrypt neural signals and protect BCIs from hacking or data leaks.

**Goal:**  
Understand what “neural encryption” means and how secure thought-sharing could work in Synaose.

**Reference:**  
- The Hidden Risks of Brain-Computer Interfaces — https://scisimple.com/en/articles/2025-03-23-the-hidden-risks-of-brain-computer-interfaces--a37or15

**Results (Summary):**  
- Explains new encryption models that protect BCIs from interception or manipulation.  
- Highlights risks like brain-data theft and “neural phishing.”  
- Discusses encryption layers added to signal processors for secure translation.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Synaose’s Filter Core must integrate adaptive encryption that learns from user brain patterns while anonymizing shared data.

### Thing 2 (Creation – Designing the Filter Core)  
**Plan:**  
Sketch conceptual roles for Synaose’s Filter Core, focusing on security and user control.

**Goal:**  
Define how the Filter Core processes neural inputs, encrypts signals, and filters what’s shareable.

**Results (Summary):**  
- The Filter Core will act like a neural firewall + translator.  
- It authenticates signals from the User Core, encrypts them, and assigns a “sharing level” (private / shared / public).  
- Could use blockchain-style validation to confirm message origin.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Filter Core = trust layer. It must prevent cross-contamination between users’ thought streams.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Neuro Rights & Data Ethics)  
**Plan:**  
Study current efforts to define human rights around brain data and privacy.

**Goal:**  
Ensure Synaose is built under ethical frameworks protecting autonomy, consent, and privacy.

**Reference:**  
- Chile: Pioneering the protection of neurorights — https://courier.unesco.org/en/articles/chile-pioneering-protection-of-neurorights

**Results (Summary):**  
- Defines “neurorights” — privacy, identity, agency, fairness, and freedom of thought.  
- Notes that Chile is the first country in the world to legislate on neurotechnologies and include “brain rights” in its constitution.  
- Advocates for “neural data sovereignty” — users own their brain signals.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Synaose should embed a “Neural Consent Protocol” in its design, ensuring users can revoke or limit thought-sharing anytime.
