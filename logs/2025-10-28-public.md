### Thing 1 (Processing – Pre-processing Pipeline for Consumer EEG)
**Plan:**  
Study and adapt the Muse-2 Part-3 article on EEG pre-processing to define a reproducible, minimal-hardware data-cleaning workflow.

**Goal:**  
Establish a reliable sequence for preparing raw Muse-2 recordings (BLE stream → CSV → cleaned signal) ready for feature extraction.

- Medium (Part 3): *Pre-processing of Muse 2 EEG Data* — https://medium.com/building-a-bedroom-bci/pre-processing-of-muse-2-eeg-data-27666baeb631  

**Results (Summary):**  
- Implemented a 1–50 Hz band-pass filter and 50/60 Hz notch filter to remove environmental noise.  
- Applied Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for artefact rejection (eye blinks, muscle movements).  
- Performed baseline correction and segmentation into 2–4 s epochs.  
- Prepared cleaned EEG segments suitable for feature extraction (power spectral density, alpha/beta ratios).  
- 💡 *Insight:* Consumer-grade EEG can yield useful features when consistent filtering and artefact removal are applied.

### Thing 2 (Integration – Feature Extraction & Dataset Consolidation)
**Plan:**  
Design scripts to merge pre-processed EEG segments with labels from prior sessions (intent commands and baseline states).

**Goal:**  
Generate a consolidated dataset ready for model training (Decoder Core Stage 1).  

**Results (Summary):**  
- Defined file-naming and metadata schema for session ID, participant, and channel mapping.  
- Prototyped Python MNE workflow for automated filtering and epoch export.  
- Verified compatibility with PyTorch-based model input pipeline.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Automated preprocessing plus consistent naming prevents label mismatch and simplifies later model debugging.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Ethical Pipeline Validation & Local Testing)
**Plan:**  
Begin small-scale Lagos testing of preprocessing scripts on sample data to validate local machine performance and ethical handling.

**Goal:**  
Ensure reproducibility and compliance with privacy guidelines before live pilot deployment.  

**Results (Summary):**  
- Tested preprocessing latency (<3 s per 10 s EEG segment) on consumer hardware.  
- Confirmed encrypted storage and session-based anonymization scripts working correctly.  
- 💡 *Insight:* Lightweight, local preprocessing improves reliability without transmitting raw signals externally.
