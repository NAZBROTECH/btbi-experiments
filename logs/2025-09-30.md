### Thing 1 (Transformation  Quick Concept Check)  
**Focus:** Review one key non-invasive BCI method (EEG).  

**Notes:**  
- EEG is **cheap, portable, and widely used**.  
- Provides **excellent temporal resolution** (captures brain activity in milliseconds).  
- Weak in **spatial resolution** (hard to know exactly *where* in the brain signals come from).  
- Very **noisy** and sensitive to movement/environment.  
- Real-world uses: seizure detection, sleep monitoring, basic BCI control, communication for locked-in patients.

### Thing 2 (Transformation  Compare Device Form Factors)  
**Focus:** Compare headset vs implant for BCI use.  

**Notes:**  
- **Headset (non-invasive):**  
  - Pros: Safe, portable, easy to use daily.  
  - Cons: Low precision, noisy signals, limited to simple tasks.  

- **Implant (invasive):**  
  - Pros: High precision, direct access to neurons, enables rich data transfer.  
  - Cons: Requires surgery, infection risk, ethical issues, not scalable for everyday people.  

**Insight:** Headsets are realistic for wide adoption, while implants remain research-focused and clinical.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance  Resources Update)  
**Focus:** Add one practical review paper on BCIs for communication.  

**Notes:**  
- Maintenance today = building resource library.  
- This paper summarizes **noninvasive BCIs used for communication/control**, especially EEG-based setups.  
- Links directly back to Thing 1 (EEG) and Thing 2 (form factors).
