### Topic 1 – Bridging Mind & Muscle: BCI-FES Rehabilitation Systems

Summary:
This article reviews how brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) paired with functional electrical stimulation (FES) are being developed to restore motor functionality in patients with paralysis or motor impairments. It highlights how detecting neural intent and delivering timed muscle stimulation can drive neuroplasticity and functional recovery. Key operational challenges include real-time latency, artifact resilience, calibration for individual users, and managing fatigue.

Insight:
For the Synapse project, this underscores our simulated pipeline’s importance: even in a software-only environment, modeling 
intent
→
activation encourages thinking about timing, response, and feedback loops. Our vision of a motor
rehabilitation
simulation within Synapse just became more grounded.

### Topic 2 – Synapse Pipeline Implication: Simulated BCI-FES Module  
Plan:
1. Add or extend module motor_rehab_sim.py to simulate neural
intent flags (e.g., attempt move arm) and corresponding muscle
activation events with variable latency and fatigue factors.
2. Define parameters like intent threshold, stimulation latency distribution, fatigue factor (simulate decline in response over time) and success/failure flags.
3. Document how this simulation module integrates with the decoder core: synthetic EEG → features → intent classifier → simulated FES trigger → log and metrics.
4. Establish a logging mechanism for results: e.g., response latency, activation success rate, simulated user fatigue over time.
