### Thing 1 (Transformation – Mind-to-Speech BCIs)
**Plan:**  
Read about how BCIs are converting neural activity into spoken language.

**Goal:**  
See how close we are to direct thought → speech systems.

**Reference:**  
- IEEE Spectrum (still good) *A New BCI Instantly Synthesizes Speech*  
  https://spectrum.ieee.org/bci-speech-synthesis?utm_source=chatgpt.com

**Results (Summary):**
- Advances allow more accurate, lower-lag speech from brain signals.  
- Helps people with communication loss.  
- Still limited vocabulary and requires invasive tech.  
- Future direction: coupling language models + neural decoding.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Neurotechnology in Work & Ethics)
**Plan:**  
Read about how neurotech may change work and the ethical risks.

**Goal:**  
Understand concerns about privacy, fairness, and worker autonomy.

**Reference:**  
- Fast Company: *Neurotechnology could revolutionize work—but it comes with ethical risks* :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Results (Summary):**
- Wearable brain monitoring could optimize productivity but risks surveillance.  
- Ethical challenges: consent, data use, mental privacy.  
- Importance of regulating how brain data is used in workplaces.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Brainwave Data Laws)
**Plan:**  
Check recent legal protections for neural data.

**Goal:**  
Know how governments are beginning to treat brainwave data legally.

**Reference:**  
- Fast Company: *Colorado’s new brain privacy law, explained* :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**Results (Summary):**
- Colorado law treats brainwave data like facial recognition — sensitive and protected.  
- Sets precedent for future neural data privacy laws.  
- Increasing recognition that mental data needs legal guardrails.
