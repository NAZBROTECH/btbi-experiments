### Thing 1 (Transformation – Real-time Speech BCIs)
**Plan:**  
Read a short news piece about BCIs that synthesize speech from brain activity.

**Goal:**  
Understand the real-world progress toward giving voice back to people who cannot speak.

**Reference:**  
- UC Berkeley Engineering: Brain-to-voice neuroprosthesis restores naturalistic speech — https://engineering.berkeley.edu/news/2025/03/brain-to-voice-neuroprosthesis-restores-naturalistic-speech/

**Results (Summary):**
- AI-based models stream intelligible speech from neural signals in near real time.  
- Significant step for communication restoration in paralysis.  
- Requires implanted electrodes + model training; still experimental.

### Thing 2 (Transformation – Clinical Summary & Impact)
**Plan:**  
Read a short NIH writeup summarizing clinical achievements and implications.

**Goal:**  
Capture the clinical perspective and real-world benefits.

**Reference:**  
- NIH: Brain-computer interface restores natural speech after paralysis — https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/brain-computer-interface-restores-natural-speech-after-paralysis

**Results (Summary):**
- Real-time conversion of neural signals to voice reduces communication delay.  
- Demonstrated in patients with severe paralysis — real-world benefit is clear.  
- Ongoing work to broaden vocabulary and improve robustness.

### Thing 3 (Maintenance – Policy & Neural Data)
**Plan:**  
Read a short news piece about regulatory & privacy concerns for neural data.

**Goal:**  
Understand how lawmakers and watchdogs are reacting to neurotech data practices.

**Reference:**  
- The Verge: Neurotech companies are selling your brain data, senators warn — https://www.theverge.com/policy/657202/ftc-letter-senators-neurotech-companies-brain-computer-interface

**Results (Summary):**
- U.S. senators urged the FTC to investigate how neurotech companies handle neural data.  
- Raises urgent questions about consent, sharing, and commercial use of brain data.  
- Signals policy momentum — expect legal/ethical frameworks to follow.
