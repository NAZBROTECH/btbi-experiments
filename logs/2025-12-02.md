### Topic 1 – Knowledge Distillation & Model Compression Concepts (Contextual Study)
Reference:

Summary:  
The article explains knowledge distillation, where a larger model transfers decision patterns to a smaller model. This improves efficiency without carrying over identity, subjective experience, or consciousness.

Insight:  
Pattern transfer ≠ mind transfer. This helps reinforce boundaries in Synapse’s communication system.

### Topic 2 – Synapse Strategy: Ensuring Clear Boundaries in Neural Communication
Plan:
1. Clarify that Synapse transmits structured neural-signal messages (similar to language), not identity, consciousness, or private thoughts.
2. Review modules to ensure naming and comments describe communication signals, not mind-reading.

Insight:
This ensures Synapse is understood as a communication interface — reducing language barriers through neural signaling while maintaining strict ethical boundaries.
