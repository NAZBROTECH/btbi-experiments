## What Synapse Is — and What It Is NOT

Synapse is an **educational, simulation-based neural signal generator**.  
It produces synthetic EEG-like activity to support learning in:

- signal processing  
- decoding algorithms  
- noise and constraint modeling  
- implant failure simulation  

### ❌ What Synapse is NOT
Synapse does **not** read minds, decode thoughts, simulate consciousness, store identity, or reconstruct cognition.  
It is **not** a BCI implant and not a tool for profiling or psychological inference.
