# Brain-to-Brain Interface (BTBI) Experiments

Welcome! 👋  
This repository documents my personal journey exploring **Brain-to-Brain Interfaces (BTBI)**.  

I am **Elon Paul Anozie Nnamdi**, based in Nigeria, and I am deeply interested in how humans might one day communicate thoughts directly — beyond traditional modes of speech or text. While I am starting small with open resources, my long-term vision is to contribute meaningfully to this exciting frontier of neuroscience and technology.  

---

## 📌 Goals
- Learn the foundations of **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**.  
- Run simple experiments with accessible hardware (EEG, Arduino, biosignal kits).  
- Explore pathways toward **direct brain-to-brain communication**.  
- Share all progress openly for collaboration and learning.  

---

## 🌍 Why This Project?
I believe BTBI has the potential to:
- Transform how humans connect and understand each other.  
- Support people with disabilities through new communication channels.  
- Open up new frontiers in neuroscience, AI, and human collaboration.  

---

## 🛠 Current Focus
- Collecting resources and learning materials.  
- Connecting with global BCI/BTBI communities (OpenBCI, NeuroTechX).  
- Planning small, proof-of-concept projects as stepping stones.  

---

## 📖 Future Plans
- Document experiments (e.g., simple EEG → computer outputs).  
- Progress toward remote brain-to-brain demonstrations.  
- Collaborate with researchers, hobbyists, and labs worldwide.

## 📚 Resources
Some beginner-friendly resources I am using:  
- [OpenBCI Documentation](https://docs.openbci.com/) – Learn about open-source EEG hardware and software.  
- [NeuroTechX Community](https://neurotechx.com/) – A global community for neurotechnology enthusiasts.  
- [Introduction to Brain–Computer Interfaces (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/brain-computer-interface) – Free/paid course on BCI basics.  
- [Awesome BCI GitHub Repo](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/awesome-bci) – Curated list of BCI projects, tools, and research.  
- [EEGLearn](http://eeglearn.org/) – Tutorials for EEG and brain-signal processing.

## 🧩 Lessons from DIY EEG Projects  
Real EEG hardware faces major limitations:
- Very low signal strength  
- High noise and electrical interference  
- Latency jitter  
- Unstable electrodes  
- Amplifier saturation  

Synapse does **not** capture real brain signals.  
To reflect real-world constraints, we include simulated “failure modes” that show how signals degrade in practice.
