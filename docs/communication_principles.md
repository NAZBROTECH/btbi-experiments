# Synapse Communication Principles

Synapse is a structured brain-to-brain communication interface.  
It transmits *neural-signal messages* that behave similarly to language.

Synapse does NOT:
- read or extract private thoughts  
- decode consciousness or identity  
- reconstruct memories or personality  

Synapse DOES:
- encode outgoing communication intent into neural signal patterns  
- transmit structured neural messages between users
- reduce communication barriers (including language differences)

This ensures the system remains a communication tool, not a mind-reading device.
