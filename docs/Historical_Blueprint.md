This blueprint keeps us grounded in 2,000+ years of proven neuroscience.
| 1791  | Luigi Galvani – Bioelectricity (frog legs) | Proved electricity is the 'spark of life' → foundation of action potential modeling in Synapse |
| 1952  | Hodgkin-Huxley equations      | Direct math behind our spike generator |
| 2025  | Synapse BTBI (Nigeria)        | First open African brain-to-brain simulation |
| 1897  | Charles Sherrington coins 'synapse'       | Defined the junction → our SynapticTransmissionPacket  |
| 1921  | Otto Loewi proves chemical transmission   | Foundation of neurotransmitter modeling in Filter Core |
| 1915  | Walter Cannon – Fight-or-Flight response      | Direct inspiration for ANS stress modulation in Synapse |
| 1932  | Cannon & Hess – Autonomic Nervous System     | Blueprint for automatic safeguards in distributed BTBI |
| 1867  | Hermann von Helmholtz – Unconscious Inference     | Foundation of predictive perception → our top-down priors |
| 1999  | Karl Friston – Predictive Coding theory            | Modern basis for brain-as-prediction-machine in Synapse |
