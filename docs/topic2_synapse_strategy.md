# Topic 2 – Synapse Strategy: Integrating Data Validation & Structured Messaging

Synapse must ensure all neural-signal communication packets are safe, valid,
and intentionally structured. To prevent malformed or unsafe packets from
entering the system, Synapse is adopting strict validation through Pydantic.

## Plan
1. Create a schema module defining message/data packet structures for Synapse using Pydantic.
2. Enforce validation on outgoing/incoming signal packets to eliminate malformed or unsafe communication data.

## Insight
Strong validation ensures Synapse remains a communication interface—not a system
that infers thoughts or identity. Structured messaging increases safety, clarity,
and reliability across all neural communication.
