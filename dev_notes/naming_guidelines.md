# Synapse Naming & Commenting Guidelines

To prevent confusion about Synapse’s purpose:

## Use names that describe:
- signal messages
- communication intent
- pattern encoding
- neural-message routing

Examples:
- intent_signal
- message_pattern
- encoded_packet
- 
eural_transmit()

## Avoid names that imply:
- mind reading
- thought extraction
- personality decoding
- consciousness simulation

Forbidden examples:
- ead_thoughts
- decode_identity
- extract_consciousness

These rules ensure Synapse is always represented as a communication interface, not a thought-reading system.
