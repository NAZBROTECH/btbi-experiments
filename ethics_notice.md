# SYNAPSE ETHICS & SAFETY NOTICE

Synapse is a **simulation-only software system**.

It does NOT:
- record real brain activity  
- decode thoughts  
- simulate consciousness or identity  
- reconstruct memories  
- interface with biological tissue  

Synapse produces **synthetic, simulated signals only**, for educational and research training.
Interpretation beyond this is scientifically inaccurate and unsafe.
